In university, staying organized can be time consuming. With five or more courses filled with assignments, essays, and tests, it is easy to fall behind and lose track of important information, such as an assignment due date. ClassSort provides a comprehensive solution to staying on top of university courses in the form of an Android app. It has three main features which can save students time and makes university easier to manage:

1) Note taking - Important details such as TA office hours for each course can be saved in the ClassSort app. Notes, and the other features, are all sorted by course.
2) File managing - Files such as assignment PDFs, lecture notes, and practice exams can be saved to the app. This means no more searching for old returned assignments, or not having lecture notes when they're needed. Files are stored offline, so an internet connection is not required.
3) Reminders - Never forget when an assignment is due, or when you're meeting the professor with easy to set reminders. Reminders display as a notification on the user's phone.
